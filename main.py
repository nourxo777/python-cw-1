print("nour")
# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8
print(4+4)
# Write a print statement that uses the division operator / 
print(4/4)
# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *
print(4*4)
# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
length = 5
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width = 10
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
area = width*length
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
print(f"the result is {area}")

# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables. 
print(f"if the length of the rectangle is {length}, and width is {width}, then the area is {area}")
